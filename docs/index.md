## Game Pillar
When we want to create a game and we start thinking how this will be designed, the first step we need is to stablish a few parameters that delimitate and guide the process of design and production. This parameters are known as Game Pillars and, as the name suggest, they're the foundations of a game. As the designers, we will work with the pillars like a filter to know if one mechanic/idea will fit well in our game or oterwhise it will spoil it.

In conclusion, we can define the Game Pilars as a list of 3 to 5 key concepts (like Gameplay & Dynamics, Emotions/Feelings, Genre/Theme/Mechanics or Art direction) that we want our game to explore and be based on.

## Why we need the Pillars?
Maybe some people are asking why they have to limit their games to 3 or 5 specific things instead of making a super game that do so many amazing things.

The reason behind these is to keep the game coherent. If you try to do everything in one game then players may be getting lost or you will not be able to deliver all these elements/emotions to a high standard.

The Game Pillars also help the rest of the developers team to understand what the game designer wants to do and expres with the game.

## Examples
Now that we know what Game Pillars are let's see some examples:

### The Last of Us

- **Crafting:** Along the game, there is a lot of loot that we will be able to get and use it to craft usefull things like the ammo. So we will be exploring all of the enviroment in search of materials for craft.
- **Story:** Last of Us is a game based on the narrative. The story that the game tell to us is one of the most important things when we play.
- **AI partners:** The game is all about building a relationship between the player’s character with the AI partner Ellie and other partners you meet throughout your journey.
- **Stealth:** Combat is used in this game, but if you were to run and gun, then the game would make your life extremely difficult. So player are encouraged to play more stealthily.
