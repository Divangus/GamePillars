## Game Pillar
When we want to create a game and we start thinking how this will be designed, the first step we need is to stablish a few parameters that delimitate and guide the process of design and production. This parameters are known as Game Pillars and, as the name suggest, they're the foundations of a game. As the designers, we will work with the pillars like a filter to know if one mechanic/idea will fit well in our game or oterwhise it will spoil it.

In conclusion, we can define the Game Pilars as a list of 3 to 5 key concepts (like Gameplay & Dynamics, Emotions/Feelings, Genre/Theme/Mechanics or Art direction) that we want our game to explore and be based on.

## Why we need the Pillars?
Maybe some people are asking why they have to limit their games to 3 or 5 specific things instead of making a super game that do so many amazing things.

The reason behind these is to keep the game coherent. If you try to do everything in one game then players may be getting lost or you will not be able to deliver all these elements/emotions to a high standard.

The Game Pillars also help the rest of the developers team to understand what the game designer wants to do and expres with the game.

## Unique Selling Point 
People might find that Game Pilars are basically the same thing as Unique Selling Points, but it doesn't encompass exactly the same things.

A unique selling point (USP) is the essence of what makes your product or service better than competitors, and a pillar is a set of features that will get particular attention during the game's development.

Obviously all your USPs will be pillars, **but a pillar is not necessarily an USP.**

## Examples
Now that we know what Game Pillars are let's see some examples:

### The Last of Us
![theLastOfUs](https://github.com/Divangus/GamePillars/blob/main/docs/images/the-last-of-us-ellie-joel.jpg?raw=true)

- **Crafting:** Along the game, there is a lot of loot that we will be able to get and use it to craft usefull things like the ammo. So we will be exploring all of the enviroment in search of materials for craft.
- **Story:** Last of Us is a game based on the narrative. The story that the game tell to us is one of the most important things when we play.
- **AI partners:** The game is all about building a relationship between the playerâ€™s character with the AI partner Ellie and other partners you meet throughout your journey.
- **Stealth:** Combat is used in this game, but if you were to run and gun, then the game would make your life extremely difficult. So player are encouraged to play more stealthily.

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
![Botw](https://github.com/Divangus/GamePillars/blob/main/docs/images/zelda.jpg?raw=true)

- **Exploration:** Player are encouraged to explore, by being able to go to any area they wish whenever they wish. The information arround the map is hidden and is the player who has to explore and discover all the missions and things that he can do over the world.
- **Traversal:** BotW offers so many modes to moves arround the world like climbing, swimming, running, paragliding and the interesting shield surfing.  
- **Scavenging:** Players are constantly needing to go through the world and search for items. From weapons which break after a few battles, to the food players must use to regain health or help them traverse through all kind of environmental hazards.
- **Combat:** Combat is very important in this game as there are a lot of hostil creatures in the world you have to defeat and a lot of mechanichs you have to do it like the parry or the dodge. Also the player can choose a lot of diferent combat styles depending on the weapon they have equiped like the sword or the spear.
- **OPTIONS:** in my opinion the most important pillar. This game presents a lot of options to the player from multiple ways and order to complete the story, to solve the puzzles or to kill the enemies. Everething the player can imagine is one more thing to solve the problem he needs, in this game there is no one way to solve the issues. 

### The Binding of Isaac
![isaac](https://github.com/Divangus/GamePillars/blob/main/docs/images/isaac.jpg?raw=true)

- **Difficulty:** one of the most important thing of the game is the difficulty that this one presents. We will have to be surviving throught diferents rooms with diferent unkown challenges. Also we can choose diferent characters that will increase the difficulty like "The Lost", a character that starts with no health and cannot gain health by any means. Therefore, it will die from any damage taken.
- **Decision making:** another pillar is the decisions we have to make in the runs, it will be very important if we take or no an item or if we enter in an especific room or not. This decisions will define how will the game progress
- **Randomness(Alea):** in this game every thing will be randomly generated so we will never know how the game will be.
- **Replayability:** this type of games are full based on the repleyability, all the games will be always different an you have to be playing the game from zero every time you finish one run to unlock more content.


### Lost Ark
![lostArk](https://github.com/Divangus/GamePillars/blob/main/docs/images/Lost-Ark-Prime-Amazon.jpg?raw=true)

- **Progression:** Lost Aek is an MMORPG so one of the fundamental pillars of the game is the leveling and character progression basic of all the RPG, getting more abilities and skill points that will make our character more powerfull 
- **Customization:** in the game every player can be whatever he want. They have character creation, class selection and the skill points, allowing them to build the abilities of they characters in diferents ways so they get diferents play styles and appearance even having the same character class. 
- **Multiplayer(MMO):** these is the most important pillar of the game. All the content of the game is based on the people interaction, making you able to play alone or with other people at anytime. We can divide this one in 3 other pillars:
    - **Competition:** having a lot of content based on pvp such as the guild wars or the arenas.
    - **Cooperation:** allowing you to play all the content of the game in cooperative with other people.
    - **Community:** these game depends a lot of his community because the game is mostly based on online interaction with oter people.

### Paradox
Also, there are some studios that have their own's Game Pillars for all their videogames. [Paradox Interactive](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/our-company/our-business/game-pillars) is an example:

## Establishing the Game Pillars
The process of defining a core Game Pillars is not difficult, but we need to have thhe process very clear. 

### The basics
- Each statement should be short, no more than a sentence.
- It should be phrased as a rule you will follow throught the development.
- Make your pillars focus on the player.

### The process
- **Choosing a target:** the first thing we need is to know in what kind of player will base our game, if we will attack to a casual target or a competitive one, if we want to do a game for killers or for archievers. A way to classify the kind of players is using the [Bartle taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types).
- **Brainstorming:** doing brainstorming session with all the team is a god way (the best) to start establishing what we want to do with the game. The advantage of this approach is that everyone understands and buys into the chosen pillars because they had a say in creating them. The downside is that this process can take time, with potentially conflicting ideas needing to be whittled down until an agreement is reached.
- **Filter the ideas:** once we have the ideas on the table we need to chose the good one's and discard the bad ones. Actually there are no bad ideas but we need to choose this ones fit better with our game target and have more synergies between the other choseen ideeas.
